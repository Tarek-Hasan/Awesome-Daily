# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.
- Prefer open source software to closed source one.
- No paid software will be allowed.
- No online service is allowed unless it has self-hosting option.
- One software for per usage purpose. So, pick a software which offers more features than other software from the same category.
- Only include multiple software for similar purpose if they have useful features unique to them.
- Prefer GUI software to CLI one.
- Only use CLI when there is no GUI app or GUI is more complicated than CLI. Yes, there are some genius developers who accomplished this seemingly impossible job.
- From multiple GUI software, choose more user friendly and nice looking one.
- Cross-platform software is preferred over single platform supported software.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.

edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
